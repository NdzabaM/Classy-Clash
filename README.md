# Classy-Clash
The 3rd and last project from the Udemy course C++ Fundamentals by GameDev.tv. This time I learnt different ways to organise my code, including creating header files and including them in the main cpp file. By far the most difficult project I worked on in this course but for every small thing that I'm able to grasp, I'm grateful

You have a knight and fight simple slime enemies. The knight has a health system, as well as a sword drawn onto him along with hit detection and key functionality, among the idle and run animations. Tiled was also introduced as a way one can build maps for my game.
